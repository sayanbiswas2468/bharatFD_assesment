# FAQ Management System

I put my best effort into this project, and I want to be upfront—I used AI assistance specifically for Redis and Docker setup, as I’m still learning these technologies. However, everything else in the project was built by me with my own understanding and effort.  

My goal is not just to complete tasks but to truly master these concepts. I am eager to gain real-world experience and learn these technologies in a professional setting.  

I would love the opportunity to grow within the company and refine my skills further. Thank you for reviewing my work!
